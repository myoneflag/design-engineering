                                H2X accounts are not to be shared without our consent, any violations of this will be an
                                infringement of Copyright laws. This is because the software is the intellectual
                                property of H2X Pty Ltd.
                            </li>

                                H2X accounts are designed for a single user only, you will experience lockouts or
                                suspensions if the account is used simultaneously in two or more locations. This is to
                                protect unlawful use of H2X software.

                                Results from any engineering software should always be double-checked when applied in
                                real-life applications. As a H2X user it is your responsibility to verify and validate
                                the output of the software with some other independent means. This is because the
                                results are all based on theoretical input and solutions. With any design, a wide
                                variety of other factors can directly impact the actual results and behaviour of real
                                life outcomes. Some examples include internal diameter of fittings, pressure loss
                                through tapware, material properties, construction inaccuracies etc. As a user you
                                understand that such variables can alter the results of H2X outcomes, and this should be
                                considered in your design and calculations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The user is to review the calculations described within the software and must not use
                                the software if they disagree with any of the calculation methods used. The user must
                                not use the software if they are unclear about how any of the calculations are
                                undertaken and must contact H2X to resolve any queries.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                As a user of H2X software, you agree to use sufficient duty of care when using H2X
                                products. This includes not designing or constructing anything outside of your abilities
                                and knowledge as an engineer. As with all engineering software, one should always
                                question the results and perform sufficient checks that the results are logical and
                                correct. H2X Pty Ltd take no responsibility for any damages, liabilities or consequences
                                resulting from any use of our software.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There are literally millions of design scenarios. This makes it impossible to test and
                                ensure accuracy in every single possible scenario. As with any software, there may be
                                bugs or errors that cause it to function incorrectly. As a user you understand that
                                although all H2X software goes through extensive testing, the risk of deviated results
                                due to software failure is still possible.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                H2X results are not to be used for design purposes unless signed off by a professional
                                and competent hydraulic engineer. The user understands that the software does not
                                provide certification as it is only offering a service for calculations and does not
                                claim to provide compliant results in relation to relevant standards. For example, the
                                software will calculate the pressure at the fixture, but the user needs to ensure that
                                that pressure is sufficient.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You, at your sole expense, will defend, indemnify and hold H2X harmless from and with
                                respect to any loss or damage (including attorneysâ€™ fees and costs) incurred in
                                connection with, any suit or proceeding brought by a third party against H2X.
